# Boardgame Websites
- The websites that can be seen above were designed with use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as the MindAR and a-frames libraries.
Their main goal was to enhance a boardgame by providing additional augmented content. The players, by scanning certain images on the board, called markers,
would be automatically led to a informative website of our design. The main goal of the boardgame itself was to teach the players about 6 types of Greek battle
ships, from ancient times all the way to the era of WW1. The chosen teaching method was Gamification.

- It should be mentioned that these sites were designed with a phone's screen as a basis, NOT a computer screen, as the scanner was implemented in a cellural
device fot the players' convinience
